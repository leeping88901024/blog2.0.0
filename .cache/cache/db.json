Content is delivered as JSON data, and images, videos and other media as files.\nThe API is available via a globally distributed content delivery network. The server closest to the user serves all content, both JSON and binary. This minimizes latency, which especially benefits mobile apps. Hosting content in multiple global data centers also greatly improves the availability of content.</p>\n<h3>Content Management API</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-management-api/\" title=\"Content Management API\">Content Management API</a> (CMA), available at <code>api.contentful.com</code>, is a read-write API for managing content. Unlike the Content Delivery API, the management API requires you to authenticate as a Contentful user. You could use the CMA for several use cases, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Automatic imports from different CMSes like WordPress or Drupal.</li>\n<li>Integration with other backend systems, such as an e-commerce shop.</li>\n<li>Building custom editing experiences. We built the <a href=\"https://app.contentful.com/\" title=\"Contentful Web app\">Contentful Web app</a> on top of this API.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Preview API</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/concepts/apis/#content-preview-api\" title=\"Content Preview API\">Content Preview API</a>, available at <code>preview.contentful.com</code>, is a variant of the CDA for previewing your content before delivering it to your customers.
